World Vaccine Tracker

Description:
Using tableau I have visualized the vaccine dataset provided by Our World in Data. The dashboard contains a mapview of Countries with people vaccinated, people vaccinated
over a Country's GDP and comparison of people partially vaccinated vs people fully vaccinated by Country.

The dashboard also contains stats to indicate people partially vaccinated, people fully vaccinated and people not vaccinated on top of the dashboard. Every sheet can be
filtered by Country or Continent.
